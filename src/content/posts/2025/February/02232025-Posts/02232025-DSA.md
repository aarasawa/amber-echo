## Problem Modeling
Being able to boil down your application of algorithms into precise problems. Meaning being able to simplify real-world structures into more abstract ones. An example would be representing the possible routes in a map as a graph. Commmon structures would be: 

| Structure Name | Abstraction Description |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Permutations   | Arrangements, or orderings, of items. |
| Subsets        | Selections from a set of items. |
| Trees          | Hierarchical relationships between items. |
| Graphs         | Relationships between arbitrary pairs of objects. |
| Points         | Locations in some geometric space. |
| Polygons       | Regions in some geometric spaces. |
| Strings        | Sequences of characters, or patterns. |

Combinatorial objects like these can be recursively decomposed, meaning you can boil down a large combinatorial structure into smaller combinatorial structures of the same type. For example, lets say you have a collection of points, separating it into two groups of points yields two collections of points. 

:::Important
Modeling your application in terms of structures and algorithms is the first step towards a solution.
