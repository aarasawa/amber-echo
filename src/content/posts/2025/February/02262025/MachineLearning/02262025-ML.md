## How Models Work
A very brief overview of how machine learning models work is that they use patterns in data to make decisions. For example, you want to create a model for a friend that trades stocks. A <b>decision tree</b> is a diagram for showing the potential results of a series of decisions. The process of capturing patterns from training data is called <b>fitting</b> or <b>training</b> the model. The bottom of a decision tree where the prediction is made is called a <b>leaf.</b>

## Pandas
The Pandas library is useful for data processing and manipulation. I have used it for filtering and sorting through data sets before, since it is a common tool used in Data Science and Machine Learning. An essential structure in Pandas is the <em>DataFrame</em> which is used for holding data during a program. 

### Loading Data Using Pandas
```Python
import pandas as pd

# Path of the file to read
file_path = '../input/folder/training_data.csv'
# Read file into variable
home_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# Print summary of data
home_data.describe()

# List the columns in the dataframe
home_data.columns
# Drop the missing values in a dataset
home_data = home_data.dropna(axis=0)
```

### Building the Model
Dot notation is used for accessing a variable from the dataframe. We are using this notation to select the column that will be used as the <b>prediction target (y).</b> Columns input into the model and later used for predicting are referred to as <b>features (X)</b>. Choosing features will depend on the target and type of model being created.

```Python
# The prediction target for a real estate model would be the price of a property
y = home_data.Price

# We can choose "features" by the column name
home_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Latitude', 'Longitude']
X = home_data[home_features]
```

For the step of building, models are made through definition, fitting, predicting, and evaluating. 

```Python
# Define tree model and fitting it with features and target variable
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

home_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 1)
home_model.fix(X, y)
```

The <em>random_state</em> can be thought of as a seed for a random number generator. Setting this "seed number" can ensure that consistent results are given when the model is run.
