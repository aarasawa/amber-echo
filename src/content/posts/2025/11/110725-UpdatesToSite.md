## Between March and Now
Between March and now, much time has passed. I started to work on the home lab, however, having a more rounded life was my main motivation. Looking back, during college I saw that I can learn any skill if I put enough time into perfecting the craft. From woodworking, metalworking, programming, photography and weightlifting. A large event happened in my life in March and it spurred me to examine the road forward.

I wanted to become a complete person on my own. In skill, interests, personhood, and as part of my community. I started to go out more. Way more. Participating in random community events in my city, I even joined a city commission. Part of my time I dedicated to volunteering. I like animals and birds so naturally I started to volunteer at a nearby humane society and bird rescue (well, the bird rescue was far). 

Most of all, I wanted to progress what I have. Starting with strength goals and creating a rhythm for going to the gym. Then technical skills and hobbies. I knew I would want to spend the bulk of my time sinking into my interests. The big thing about me is that I gather interests like Smeagol. I find one thing and look at neighboring topics and spread into them. To my detriment, it causes my attention to spread too thin and eventually makes it hard to keep up with all of them. 

This time, I decided to commit to one. Up to the point I get really good at it. Like decently good where I feel comfortable giving advice, training others, and practicing the hobby in my own home (if I had the resources). 

## New Hobbies
The new hobby I chose was pottery. Very random. Well, not really, but to everyone else it is. If you imagine craft skills as a skill tree. The crafts I wanted to get into the most were woodworking and blacksmithing. I had practice with them in college, but being able to maintain them at home without equipment and money was impossible. And this being LA, classes and studio access are expensive. 

I had always thought pottery was not something I was interested in. This sounds odd, but in my mind it lacked a tangibility that woodworking and blacksmithing had. However, there was a pottery studio about 5 minutes from my house. In addition, clay is cheaper than wood and scrap metal. Tools are cheaper. Studio access is cheaper. I signed up for monthly classes and simply saw them as a way of meditation. Time to focus in a way different than I would focus at work. Initially, it was difficult to find the spark of interest. 

What I mean is, that with my other established hobbies like photography and weightlifting, the interest is there. I watch videos. Practice technique. I find the urge to practice or go out and do the activity. With pottery, it was nice have physical products I could make and show people. However, the process was not exciting. I told myself I would take a break after completing the series. I was quickly burning out of it due to the non-interest. Took handbuilding classes, took family to weekend workshops, and every class in the wheel throwing series. And somewhere along the way the spark caught fire. 

Sometime later I will start posting what I make.

## Going Forward
Going forward I am going to try to post at least once a week. Hopefully spur myself into practicing coding along the way. While I was at work I noticed that my knowledge was very rusty. The gears were starting to rust as I stared at the code. I even struggled to get npm dev running. 

Anyway, yeah, that's what I want to do.
