## GROUP BY and HAVING

When I initially encountered this, I thought I had it down but when attempting some problems I drew a lot of blanks. Part of the issue was I was getting <code>ORDER BY</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code>.

It is not too bad after some practice. You can filter by row before grouping using WHERE. As well as filtering through groups or applying aggregating functions post-grouping through HAVING.

``` sql
-- Row filtering
SELECT continent, name
  FROM world
 WHERE population < 10000000
 GROUP BY continent

-- Group filtering
SELECT continent, name
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) <= 250000000
```

## Use Cases for =, LIKE, IN

## Problem 11 JOIN Operations

For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored. Having issues with correctly counting the goals. 

```sql
SELECT matchid, mdate, team1, team2, teamid
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
 WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
```

I came down to this query to list all the possible matches with POL in them that had goals. When GROUP BY was not being used, it seemed that the query was aggregating COUNT(teamid) under 1 date. I then added a GROUP BY mdate to group by date since only 1 date was appearing. This succeeded in separating the dates, however they were in the wrong order. 

For some reason, rather than grouping by matchid, I chose to try and use another ORDER BY before GROUP BY, however this would throw an error. This was the eventual answer:

```sql
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(teamid)
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
 WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
 GROUP BY matchid
```
