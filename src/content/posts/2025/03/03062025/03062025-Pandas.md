## Grouping
<code>groupby()</code> creates a group based on the parameter provided. You can use summary functions and mappings on top of grouping. For instances you need to transform groups of data. 

<code>agg()</code> runs different functions on the DataFrame at the same time. 

```python
# This is
reviews.value_counts()

# Equivalent to this
reviews.groupby('points').points.count()

reviews.groupby(['country']).price.agg([len, min, max])
```

## Multi-Indexes
If you think of indexes as grouping along a single attribute. <b>Multi-indexes</b> has many layers to its grouping. In general, we will use <code>reset_index()</code> for converting a multi-index method into a regular index. 

```python
countries_reviewed = reviews.groupby(['country', 'province']).description.agg([len])
```

## Sorting
The basic sorting method is <code>sort_values()</code>. The default order for this method is in ascending order, but descending can be specified. <code>sort_index</code> uses indexes for sorting, but is takes the same arguments as sort_values(). 

```python
# Example of sort_values
countries_reviewed.sort_values(by='len', ascending=False)

# Example of sort_index
countries_reviewed.sort_index()
```
