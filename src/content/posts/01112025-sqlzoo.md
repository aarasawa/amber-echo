## Problem: Difficult Questions That Utilize Techniques Not Covered In Prior Sections

Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population. If this were a programming problem, a naive approach would look like:

```python
# Where world is a dict of continents, which are dicts of countries
# Countries can be a tuple
continent_lst = []
country_count = # of countries in continent
count = 0
for continent in world:
    for country in continent:
        if country[population] <= 25000000:
            count += 1
        if country_count == count:
            continent_lst.append(continent)
    count = 0
```

Separating this into steps:

1. Find the countries for each continents
2. Find countries where the population <= 25000000
3. Find continent where all countries have a population <= 25000000

```sql
--- 1.
SELECT continent, name
  FROM world

--- 2.
SELECT continent, name
  FROM world
 WHERE population <= 25000000

--- 3. 
SELECT continent
  FROM world
 WHERE continent IN ALL(SELECT continent, name
                          FROM world
                         WHERE population <= 25000000 )
```

My problem with constructing subqueries is I am getting stuck on the column names. I keep thinking of them as variables you would see in a normal program that hold values. But in SQL, they are a more general representation for what data is being selected. Researching new tools.

### MAX

<code>MAX</code> used for returning the largest value in a column OR group. When used in conjunction with GROUP BY, it allows MAX to analyze groups of rows.

### HAVING

<code>HAVING</code> allows you to filter groups of rows affected by GROUP BY and apply conditions to aggregating functions such as MAX.

### HAVING vs. WHERE

| WHERE | HAVING |
|--------|-------|
|Filters rows BEFORE grouping|Filters groups AFTER grouping|
|CANNOT use aggregate functions|CAN use aggregate functions|
|Applies to ROWS|Applies to GROUPS|
