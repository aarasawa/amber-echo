## Introduction Post

This is website will be mainly for documenting the process of learning. Capturing any a-ha moments while I work on various projects and read various things. I will be about books, programming, weightlifting, photography -- pretty much the things that I enjoy doing to want to get better in.

In the coming year, I want to increase my efficiency in problem-solving particularly for programming. While also practicing other skills in development.

As for hobbies, I want to start throwing in cardio to my weightlifting regimen.
