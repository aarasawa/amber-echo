## Introduction
It has been quite a while since I have had to confront DSA. As such, I am going to start brushing up from the beginning. The resources I will use are Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual and CLS Introduction to Algorithms. 

## Robot Tour Optimization
The first part for demonstrating the difficulty of finding optimized solutions. A solution for one problem does not necessarily span to all types of that general problem. An issue for this example is that the shortest cycle between points. Different arrangements of points are given to explain the concept of heuristics and to introduce the concept of the <em>traveling salesman problem</em>.
